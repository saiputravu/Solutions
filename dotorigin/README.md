# Solutions

I made a C++ solution initially and realised, once I got to the next stage that python would be faster to code.

The python solution and C++ solution for the first challenge are identical.
The second solution is only in python.

To find the answer you have to do. Fruit name is pretty obvious from an initial scroll through the results.

```bash

grep (fruitname) results.txt
```

To unzip you need a password (if you do not have it please contact me)
```
mkdir output;cd output
unzip solutions
```
